# Deep_learning_work
In this project i have create a model of cat and dog which identify any image whether it is dog or cat.
for this i have used multiple ways to train my cat and dog model
things used in this model are under as:
  1: pre-trained model of VGG16
  2: used all pre-trained layers except the top one(Classifier layer).
  3: add own dense layer into pre-trained layers.
  4: fine-tunning
